# Here is where my first HTML/CSS projects will be!

## Projects

### Space Project - https://github.com/jmternes/HTML-CSS-Projects/blob/main/SpaceProject/index.html
##### This is a page for an imaginary Space Travel company, complete with a navigation bar, an image gallery, and a form - styled with CSS.

### NBA Database Site - https://github.com/jmternes/bootstrap_4/blob/master/index.html
##### This page includes a navigation bar, a two-column layout, and was styled with Bootstrap - my first time using a CSS library.
